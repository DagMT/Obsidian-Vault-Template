# Progressively summarize and make conceptual notes for a recent input

## Why distill?

- The point of this stage is to distill your notes to serve your future self.
- By distilling our highlights from the content we consume, we let the more important shining stars burn brighter.

- ### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Layer 1 - Bolding</mark>
	- Try to bold only 10% of the material you initially highlighted.

- ### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Layer 2 - Highlighting</mark>
	- In this layer, you once again try to highlight only 10%, which usually only allows for key terms and ideas.

- ### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Layer 3 - Creating a summary </mark>
	- If I end up revisiting an input note, I should create a header called Summary to add a few sentences giving a high-level overview of the contents inside.

- Doing these processes will preserve your notes for future use, but with Obsidian, you can grow a web of ideas to compound your knowledge as you learn more.
- To take effective conceptual notes, you need to follow two key principles:

- Individual Brilliance — Having a note focused on only one idea allows for connections.
	- Instead of a big note like "Second Brain", you can clarify your point by making a note on how "Second brains give us a space to think", or "Second brain apps like Obsidian mimic our brain's learning process"

	- ==**Single-focused**== — If a piece of content has insights for a certain concept scattered throughout, you can create an atomic note to combine the information all into one place.

	- ==**Single source of truth**== — By making atomic notes, we can use them as a foundation when consuming future content - we won't be prone to highlighting the same thing over and over again.

- **Connectivity** is about fostering relationships between these individual stars, helping you understand and add layers to your knowledge galaxy.
	- ==**Understanding the Essence:**== The point of connecting your notes is to understand and add nuance by building off of what you already know.
	- ==**Pattern Recognition:**== As connections foster, patterns emerge, painting a beautiful sky filled with constellations of interlinked ideas, helping you understand and retain knowledge that wouldn't have been possible with linear note-taking.
