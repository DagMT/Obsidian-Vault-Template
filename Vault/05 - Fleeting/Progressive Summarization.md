## Why distill?

==The point of this stage is to distill your notes to serve your future self.

You need to distill the content you consume into notes you can easily look back upon in the future.

Imagine this as assembling your own constellation, each star representing a note that, when connected, forms a unique pattern, telling a story only you can tell. It’s an exciting process filled with discovery, so strap in and let’s launch! 

## Distilling highlights

==By distilling our highlights from the content we consume, we let the more important shining stars burn brighter.==

Second brain pioneer Tiago Forte suggests a method called progressive summarization, which includes three layers of distillation:

### Layer 1 - Bolding ![💪](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4aa/72.png)

==***Try to bold only 10% of the material you initially highlighted.***

**When you find yourself revisiting a piece of content, bold the main points to guide the attention of your future self.

To bold text in Obsidian, you can use the usual Ctrl/Cmd+B hotkey on selected text, or you can surround text with ***like this***

### Layer 2 - Highlighting ![🚨](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f6a8/72.png)

==In this layer, you once again try to highlight only 10%, which usually only allows for key terms and ideas.

To highlight text in Obsidian, you can surround text with == like this ==

If you want to take your highlighting to the next level, you can download the Highlightr plugin, which will let you highlight in different colors for different reasons.

### Layer 3 - Creating a summary ![📝](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4dd/72.png)

==If I end up revisiting an input note, I create a header called Summary to add a few sentences giving a high-level overview of the contents inside.

For articles or videos, it can be a few sentences, but for longer-form content books, I create a separate note for it called an Application Note. In this application note, I do things like:

- round up the most memorable quotes
- summarize the book in three sentences
- extract action items I can do

You can learn about this process in my video on how I take book notes ![📚](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f4da/72.png)

​

Now, ==doing the above process will preserve your notes for future use, but what if I told you there was a new paradigm-shifting way of extracting the essence from your notes?== ![🤯](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f92f/72.png)

In school you were taught to take notes sequentially, organizing them by classes and writing down the information in the same structure as the teacher presents it...

But ==with Obsidian, you can grow a web of ideas to compound your knowledge as you learn more.

==To do so, you need to learn how to create conceptual notes,
notes that organize information based on ideas rather than the source you got them from.

==To take effective conceptual notes, you need to follow two key principles.

Imagine for a moment, each piece of knowledge as a twinkling star in the vast space of your mind. The **atomicity** principle revolves around creating small, yet powerful notes — your very own stars — each shining bright with a single focused idea.

### ==**Atomicity: Creating Your Shining Stars ![✨](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/2728/72.png)** 

==Why is it important to keep your notes small?

- ==**Individual Brilliance** — Having a note focused on only one idea allows for connections,==unlike documents where there might be too many unrelated ideas for it to be meaningful and unique. ==Instead of a big note like "Second Brain", you can clarify your point by making a note on how "Second brains give us a space to think", or "Second brain apps like Obsidian mimic our brain's learning process"==
- ==**Single-focused** — If a piece of content has insights for a certain concept scattered throughout, you can create an atomic note to combine the information all into one place.== But be careful! If we add too much in an atomic note, we're pretty much just creating a document again. 

- ==**Single source of truth** — By making atomic notes, we can use them as a foundation when consuming future content - we won't be prone to highlighting the same thing over and over again,== since we'll already have the knowledge in our conceptual note we can build off of.

#### **Putting it into practice ![🏋️‍♀️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f3cb_fe0f_200d_2640_fe0f/72.png)** 

- **Inspiration from Highlights:** Use bolded or highlighted parts as inspiration for your new notes and titles. When you create a new atomic note, embark on a brain-dumping session, sketching out all that you comprehend and have learned.
- **Subjectivity is Your Power:** Your choice of atomic notes is a personal journey. Feel the freedom to choose what resonates with you.

### ==**Connectivity: Drawing Your Constellations ![🌠](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f320/72.png)** 

As we venture further, it’s time to interlink these stars, to find patterns and constellations that narrate the tales of your intellectual journey. ==**Connectivity** is about fostering relationships between these individual stars, helping you understand and add layers to your knowledge galaxy.

==Why is connecting notes important?

- ==**Understanding the Essence:** The point of connecting your notes is to understand and add nuance by building off of what you already know.== Whether you make connections to things you know in your primary brain, or are stored in your second brain, you are critically putting in effort to understand the essence of the idea.
- ==**Pattern Recognition:** As connections foster, patterns emerge, painting a beautiful sky filled with constellations of interlinked ideas, helping you understand and retain knowledge that wouldn't have been possible with linear note-taking.== After all, it's the way our brain understands and consolidates information ![🤩](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f929/72.png)

I like using Fei-Ling Tseng’s idea compass framework as inspiration, where each direction of the compass is a type of link you can make from a note

- North links try to find the source or parent of the note
- West links find similar notes
- East links are for transformation, finding contrasting ideas, and challenging the note
- South links are for what it causes

To help prompt your own connection-making, ask yourself (or ChatGPT) the following questions:

NORTH: “Where does X come from?” what are its origin? what group/category does X belong to? what exists an order of magnitude higher? zoom out. what gave birth to X? what causes X

WEST: “What is similar to X?” what other disciplines could X already exist in? what other disciplines could benefit from X? what are other ways to say/do X?

SOUTH: “Where can X lead to?” what does X contribute to? what group/category could X be the headline of? what exists an order of magnitude lower? zoom in. what does X nurture?

EAST: “What competes with X?” what is the opposite of X? what is X missing? its disadvantage? what could supercharge X?
